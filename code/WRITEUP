I. Requirements:

	create 7 different types of threads: Passengers, Airport Liaisons, Airline Check-In Staff, 
		Cargo Handlers, Screening Officers, Security Inspectors, and an Airport Manager.
		
	Each thread type has different responsibilities
		I. Passengers:
			+ There must be at least 20 passengers
			+ two types: Executive and Economy
			+ Each carries 2-3 pieces baggage and a ticket
			
			+ Passengers are created
			+ Passenger waits in shortest line of Airline Liaisons
            + When Passenger is called, gives AL ticket
			+ Passenger either waits in executive or shortes economy line of the Check-In Staff of the airline 
				specified by the AL depending on their type
			+ When called, Passenger gives ticket and baggage to CIS
			+ Passenger waits in shortest Screening Officer line
			+ If necessary, Passenger will undergo questioning before continuing
			+ If Security Inspector gives ok, Passenger gives boarding pass
			+ Passenger proceeds to boarding area and waits for the boarding announcement
		II. Airport Liaison:
			+ There can be 5 to 7 Airport Liaisons
			
			+ AL calls one passenger at a time
			+ When AL recieves ticket from Passenger, will direct Passenger to correct Airline
			+ AL records the amount of baggage and which Airline it goes to 
		III. Airline Check-In Staff:
			+ There must be 3 to 5 Check-in Staff per Airline
			+ one line per CIS plus one executive passenger line per airline
			
			+ Each CIS calls one Passenger at a time (executive line has priority over their own line)
			+ CIS takes asks for Passenger ticket and baggage
			+ CIS gives Passenger boarding pass with seat number assignment (no duplicates per airline)
			+ CIS tags Passenger baggage with airline code and weight
			+ CIS puts baggage on conveyor belt (shared by all airlines)
			+ CIS dismisses Passenger (?)
			+ CIS records number of passengers to check in and their baggage count
			
			+ CIS can go on break if economy AND their line are both empty
			+ When all Passengers check in, close check-in kiosk (all go on break?)
         
		IV. Cargo Handler
			+ There can be between 6 to 10 Cargo Handlers
			
			+ CH will pick up baggage from conveyor, read airline code, and drop off at appropriate aircraft.
            + CH record number of baggage loaded into each aircraft
			
			+ CH can go on break when conveyor is empty
            + CH all on break or at work at the same time (all or none)
		V. Screening Officer:
			+ SO handles one Passenger at a time from their line
			+ SO generates Pass/Fail report on Passenger (percentage chance of fail)
			+ SO sends Passenger and report to first available Security Inspector
		VI. Security Inspector:
			+ There must be the same number of SI's as SO's
			
			+ SI handles one Passenger at a time
			+ SI creates their own PASS/FAIL report
			+ If either SO or SI security reports are FAIL, SI sends Passenger to be questioned
			+ SI must handle their own Passenger returning from questioning before another Passenger from any SO
			+ SI verifies that each cleared Passenger holds a valid boarding pass
			+ SI records number of Passengers cleared per airline 
		VII. Airport Manager:
			+ There is only one airport manager
			
			+ AM checks reports (passenger or baggage) at random intervals to ensure no race conditions
            + AM signals back to work if there is baggage and CH's are on break
            + When all Passengers and baggage have reached the airline, AM makes boarding announcement
			
			+ AM never goes on break

    There must be at least 3 airlines 

II. Assumptions:
	+ The 2-3 baggage items handled by the check-in staff per passenger does not include their carry-on baggage
	+ One aircraft/flight per airline
	+ Any number of Screening Officers/Security Inspectors allowable as long as their relationship remains 1 to 1
	+ Screening Officers have lines exactly like Airport Liaisons
	+ SO's hold their current Passenger until sending them to available SI
	+ Passengers, Airport Liaisons, Screening Officers, and Security Inspectors never go on break
	+ All Passenger baggage checked takes up one "slot" on the conveyor (is treated as a single item)
	+ SI have lines... the only passengers to get in those lines are those returning from questioning
	+ Passengers place their bags down all at the same time.
	+ Check-in staff and cargo handlers pick up a customer's bags all at once.

III. Design:

	Airport Manager: on continual loop
		+ grab conveyor lock and wake up CH's if (onBreak_CH && #bags > 0)
			+ check baggage statistics, then release
		+ grab airlineLock[airline#] and wake up CIS's if (onbreak && PassLeft > 0)
			+ check statistics, then release
		+ check AL statistics
		+ check SO/SI statistics
		+ if (allPassArrived[airline#] && allBagsArrived[airline#]) call for Boarding[airline#]
		+ thread yield for awhile, then do it all again
		
		+ when all flights are off, gather all statistics and compare?
	Cargo Handlers: on continual loop
		+ grab conveyor lock
			+ if onBreakCH, go on break as well (release)
			+ else check for bags
				+ if no bags, signal onBreakCH and go on break
				+ else remove first bags sighted [and record statistics]
					then release lock, and take to appropriate airline
	Security Inspector: on continual loop
		+ set busy status to false and whether next passenger has undergone questioning to false
		+ grab SILine lock
			+ if (Passenger in line)-passengers returning from questioning only- signal them
			+ else wait for SO to give a Passenger and signal them
				then set busy to true, grab SI lock, and release SILine lock
		+ if Passenger was questioned, pass them onward [and record statistics]
		+ else probability-pass/fail Passenger
			+ if (SOFail || SIFail) then send to questioning, set busy to false, release SI lock
			+ else pass Passenger onward [and record statistics], set busy to false, release SI lock
	Screening Officer: on continual loop
		+ grab SOLine lock
			+ if (Passenger in line) signal them
			+ else wait for Passenger to get in line
		+ grab SO lock, release SOLine lock
		+ probability-pass/fail Passenger
		+ grab SILine lock
			+ if (any SI = NoLine && NotBusy) send Passenger and SOPass/Fail report
			+ else wait for available SI
		+ when Passenger sent on, release SILine and SO locks
	Airport Liaison: on continual loop
		+ grab ALLine lock
			+ if (Passenger waiting) then signal them
			+ else wait for Passenger
		+ grab AL lock, release ALLine lock
		+ count number of bags they have, get Passenger ticket, [and record statistics]
			then point them to correct airline
		+ release AL lock
	CheckIn Staff: on continual loop
		+ Set which airline they are in
		+ if (execLineEmpty && ownLineEmpty) go on break
		+ else if (execLineLength > 0) grab execLine lock
			+ signal Passenger, grab CIS lock, release execLine lock
			+ get ticket, give boarding pass with unique seat #
			+ grab conveyor lock
			+ take baggage, mark it with airline number, put it in 'empty' slot on conveyor
			+ [and record statistics]
			+ release conveyor lock, release CIS lock
		+ else if (ownLineLength > 0) grab CISLine lock
			+ signal Passenger, grab CIS lock, release CISLine lock
			+ grab conveyor lock
			+ take baggage, mark it with airline number, put it in 'empty' slot on conveyor
			+ [and record statistics]
			+ release conveyor lock, release CIS lock
	Passenger
		+ look at ticket to find executive/or-not status
		+ grab ALLine lock
			+ get in shortest line, release ALLine lock
			+ when signaled, grab AL lock (approach desk)
			+ give ticket
			+ when signaled, release AL lock
		+ at appropriate airline:
			+ if (exec) grab execLine lock, wait in line, release execLine lock
			+ else grab CISLine lock, wait in shortest line, release CISLine lock
			+ when signaled by CIS, grab CIS lock (approach desk)
			+ give ticket, give baggage, recieve boarding pass, release CIS lock
		+ grab SOLine lock
			+ wait in shortest line, release SOLine lock
			+ when signaled, grab SO lock (approach desk)
		+ if assigned SI by SO, release SO lock, grab that SI lock (approach them)
			+ go to questioning OR go to boarding area (pass/fail from SI), release SI lock
		+ if returning from questioning, grab own SI's SILine lock, wait in line, release SILine lock
			+ grab SI lock (approach them)
			+ go to boarding area, release SI lock
		+ when recieve boarding call, board plane

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)

            + How to test

			To test, simply type in -t[test number]
			For example, to run test one, type "-t1"
	
			Test 1: Passenger selects the shortest line
			Test 2: Passenger is directed by Liaison to correct counters
			Test 3:	Economy class passengers enter the shortest line while Executives enter their correct line
			Test 4: Executives are given priority
			Test 5: Screening officer chooses an available security inspector each time a passenger comes in
			Test 6: Cargo Handlers choose bags from the conveyor system each time and go on a break if no bags
			Test 7: Handing over of the hand luggage by the passenger to the screening officer
			Test 8: Passenger returns to the same security inspector after further questioning
			Test 9: Baggage weights of all the passengers of a particular airline should match the weights of the bag
				reported by the cargo handlers 
			Test 10: Handing over of boarding pass by the passenger to the security inspector
		

- How to run the test cases, the commands, the arguments and so on.
		
			See above. 
			To the run the entire simulation, type "-p2"

            + Test Output

- Describe the testing output. You don't have to dump all the output info. Just make sure your description can exactly reflect your output.

			* Note: all output is derived from the same guidelines as specified in the assignment requirements

			Test 1: Passengers are initialized, and they  go to the shortest line for the Airport Liaison
			Test 2: Liaison looks at the passengers ticket and directs the passenger to the correct counter
			Test 3: While going to check in staff, economy passengers select the shortest line and the executives go to their own line 
			Test 4: Executives are cleared before passengers, given the check in staff is not currently working with anyone 
			Test 5: Screening officer looks for an available security inspector, and then tells the passenger to go there.If there are no inspectors
				available, the screening officer will tell the passenger to go to shortest wait. The passenger will wait until the inspector is ready.
			Test 6: Cargo handlers remove bags from conveyor belt and then go on break if no bags
				This test only has cargo handlers and a conveyor belt.
			Test 7:	Interaction between passenger and screening officer
			Test 8: Passenger returns to the same security inspector after they go for further questioning
			Test 9: Baggage weights should match the tallies reported by cargo handlers 
			Test 10: Handing over of boarding pass to security inspector
		


VI. Discussion:

            + Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
			
			Test 1: Passenger selects the shortest line
			Test 2: Passenger is directed by Liaison to correct counters
			Test 3:	Economy class passengers enter the shortest line while Executives enter their correct line
			Test 4: Executives are given priority
			Test 5: Screening officer chooses an available security inspector each time a passenger comes in
			Test 6: Cargo Handlers choose bags from the conveyor system each time and go on a break if no bags
			Test 7: Handing over of the hand luggage by the passenger to the screening officer
			Test 8: Passenger returns to the same security inspector after further questioning
			Test 9: Baggage weights of all the passengers of a particular airline should match the weights of the bag
				reported by the cargo handlers 
			Test 10: Handing over of boarding pass by the passenger to the security inspector


            + Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)

			Test 1: Passenger selects the shortest line
			Test 2: Passenger is directed by Liaison to correct counters
			Test 3:	Economy class passengers enter the shortest line while Executives enter their correct line
			Test 4: Executives are given priority
			Test 5: Screening officer chooses an available security inspector each time a passenger comes in.
				However, this often times is security inspector 0. 
			Test 6: Cargo Handlers choose bags from the conveyor system each time and go on a break if no bags.
				Some cargo handlers do not go on break, since they are already asleep. 
			Test 7: Handing over of the hand luggage by the passenger to the screening officer
			Test 8: Passenger returns to the same security inspector after further questioning
			Test 9: Baggage weights of all the passengers of a particular airline should match the weights of the bag
				reported by the cargo handlers 
			Test 10: Handing over of boarding pass by the passenger to the security inspector


            + Explanation

                        - Explain your experiment result.

			Test 1: Works correctly
			Test 2: Works correctly
			Test 3:	Works correctly
			Test 4: Works correctly
			Test 5: However, this often times is security inspector 0. The reason for this is because the screening officer does not 
				increment the value of the security inspector's "line". So, other screening officers will see that security inspector 0 is 
				free, and send their passengers there. In real life, this could be explained a screening officer not seeing anyone 
				that the security inspector is working with and sending their passenger there. All screening officers could do this 
				at the same time, since to them, the security inspector looks free (the passenger from other screening officers has not arrived 
				yet).  
			Test 6: Some cargo handlers do not go on break, since they are already asleep. 
			Test 7: Works correctly
			Test 8: Works correctly
			Test 9: Works correctly 
			Test 10: Works correctly

// synch.cc 
//	Routines for synchronizing threads.  Three kinds of
//	synchronization routines are defined here: semaphores, locks 
//   	and condition variables (the implementation of the last two
//	are left to the reader).
//
// Any implementation of a synchronization routine needs some
// primitive atomic operation.  We assume Nachos is running on
// a uniprocessor, and thus atomicity can be provided by
// turning off interrupts.  While interrupts are disabled, no
// context switch can occur, and thus the current thread is guaranteed
// to hold the CPU throughout, until interrupts are reenabled.
//
// Because some of these routines might be called with interrupts
// already disabled (Semaphore::V for one), instead of turning
// on interrupts at the end of the atomic operation, we always simply
// re-set the interrupt state back to its original value (whether
// that be disabled or enabled).

// Semaphore::Semaphore
// 	Initialize a semaphore, so that it can be used for synchronization.

//	"debugName" is an arbitrary name, useful for debugging.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Semaphore::P
// 	Wait until semaphore value > 0, then decrement.  Checking the
